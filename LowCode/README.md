# LowCode example

The low code examples uses [Deck.gl](https://deckgl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) from with [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/).

## Demo

- Download the full month of AIS data from the Danish Maritime Authority [aisdk-2023-01.zip (16GB)](http://web.ais.dk/aisdata/aisdk-2023-01.zip)
- Open the notebooks located in the `data/` folder
- Run the notebook. Note, this can take 5-10 minutes since it's processing ~100 million GPS locations.
- Explorer the visulizations directly within the notebook or copy the resulting files to Kepler.gl.
